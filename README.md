GCode-comments-cleaner
---------------------

Firefox [Greasemonkey] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (or Chrome [Tempermonkey] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)) userscript for bulk Google Code wiki comments removal. It's really helpfull if you have hundreds of outdated comments in wiki articles.

It adds **delete all above** link near familiar **delete comment** link. You need project editor permission and should logged in for bulk delete. Also you can install script directly from [userscripts.org] (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/156366)

**_Notice: in case Greasemonkey did not load Cleaner script properly you need to manually add user includes with URLs of pages you need to clean._**

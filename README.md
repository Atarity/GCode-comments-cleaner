GCode-comments-cleaner
---------------------

Firefox [Greasemonkey] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (or Chrome [Tempermonkey] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)) userscript for bulk Google Code wiki comments removal. It's really helpfull if you have hundreds of outdated comments in wiki articles.

It adds **delete all above** link near familiar **delete comment** link. You need project editor permission and should logged in for bulk delete.

GCode-comments-cleaner
---------------------

Firefox [Greasemonkey] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) userscript for bulk Google Code wiki comments removal. It's really helpfull if you have hundreds of outdated comments in wiki articles.

It adds **delete all above** link near familiar **delete comment** link. You need project editor permission and should logged in for bulk delete.

####TODO:

1. Clear all above instead clear all
2. Parse comments with GoogleCode-buggy markdown (e.g. unfinished `<b>, <i>` etc.)
